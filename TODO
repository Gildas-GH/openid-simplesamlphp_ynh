* Create shortcut openid url
- Currently it is too long :
  http://mydomain.org/openid/module.php/openidProvider/user.php/myusername
- Create handler at : http://mydomain.org/openid/username with proper <link> elements ?
- Use redirect magic ?

* HTTPS/self signed certificate
- Verify that with a properly signed cert, the https openid url is recognized by consumers
- Write some prosa about this in the web pages
- Add option to install only the https site, with standard rewrite all http->https

* Theming
- see http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-theming
- hide information that are exposed via theme

* Language
- hide the list of langages, retrieve the system langage during install,
and enable only english and this one

* SREG
- apparently, the provider does not return SREG values (name, email...) to consumer.
- ask upstream if it is supported (I don't see any option for this)

* Yunohost SSO
- Is it possible to rely on yunohost sso as auth source, instead of ldap :
  * if already loggued into yunohost sso, no need to type a password again
  * if not loggued, redirect to /ynhsso to ask the password and return to openidprovider
  * look at sources/modules/exampleauth

* Deactivate as much simplesamlphp modules as possible
- check if it is really needed to have the saml idp
